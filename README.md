# Lunar Crater Detection
The repository showcases the code and theory put forth for my Masters' thesis project on detection of lunar surface craters using images from Chandrayaan 2.
I employed You Only LookOnce version 8 (YOLOv8 in short) by Ultralytics for object detection. 
I used more than 700 images from Orbiter High Resolution Camera (OHRC) onboard Chandrayaan 2 to create my dataset. The dataset was labelled using the python code [here] {Labelimg for image annotations.ipynb}
